# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## 1. Overview of the analysis: 
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
